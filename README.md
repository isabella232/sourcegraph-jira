# Jira extension for Sourcegraph

A [Sourcegraph extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) that enhances GitHub with better [Atlassian Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) integration:

- link previews to Jira issues (wherever a Jira issue URL is mentioned in GitHub issues and pull requests)
- autocompletion in text areas for Jira issues (by key and summary), similar to GitHub's builtin autocompletion for GitHub issues

**Status:** WIP
